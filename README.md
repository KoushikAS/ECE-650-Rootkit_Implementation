# Project #5: Rootkit Implementation
ECE 650 â€“ Spring 2023

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a portion of a Rootkit to gain practical experience in kernel programming, understanding system calls within the kernel, and executing malicious activities against a system. The project involved developing a kernel module and an attack program that discreetly performs actions on a Linux system running Ubuntu 20.04.

## Project Structure
- `sneaky_mod.c`: Source code for the sneaky kernel module.
- `sneaky_process.c`: Source code for the sneaky attack program.
- `Makefile`: Compilation instructions for the sneaky process and kernel module.

## Features
- **Kernel Module (`sneaky_mod.c`):**
  - Conceals the `sneaky_process` executable from commands like `ls` and `find`.
  - Hides the `/proc/<sneaky_process_id>` directory.
  - Masks changes made to `/etc/passwd` by the sneaky process.
  - Removes the module's entry from `/proc/modules`.

- **Attack Program (`sneaky_process.c`):**
  - Prints the process ID of the sneaky process.
  - Copies `/etc/passwd` to `/tmp/passwd` and appends a new line for user authentication.
  - Loads the sneaky kernel module, passing its process ID as an argument.
  - Waits for a user input ('q') to proceed with the next steps.
  - Unloads the sneaky kernel module.
  - Restores the original `/etc/passwd` file.

## Compilation and Execution
- Compile the project using the provided `Makefile`:
  ```bash
   make all
  ```

- Run the sneaky process with root privileges:
  ```bash
   sudo ./sneaky_process
  ```


## Working with the Virtual Machine
- Tested on a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04) hosted on Duke's VM service.
- Kernel version: Linux 5.4.0-104-generic.
- Development environment set up using `sudo apt-get install`.

## Safety Measures
- Implemented on a dedicated VM to prevent system damage.
- Utilized VM snapshots for easy recovery from potential issues.

## Submission
- Project submission includes `sneaky_mod.c`, `sneaky_process.c`, and `Makefile`.
- Packaged as a zip file named `proj5_netid.zip` for submission.

## Additional Notes
- The project provided insights into how rootkits can manipulate system-level operations.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding kernel-level programming for cybersecurity.
